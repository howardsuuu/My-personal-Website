I am using Javascript, HTML, and CSS to build my personal website.
HTML - I mainly use HTML to construct the architecture of my wesite, for example, where should the column been out.
CSS - After using HTML to sketch it, I then used CSS to customize all kinds of elements, for example text-size, color and animation.
Javascript - Compare to HTML and CSS, I know little about JS, I mainly use the boostrap as my HTML, CSS,and JS library.
